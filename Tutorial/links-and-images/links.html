    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>This example is about links and <a href='images.html'>images</a>.</p>
    <p>this page is about links! there are three kinds of links:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Absolute Links, like to
        <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'
        target='_blank'>Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource for web developers.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>These are best to direct users to a different website</li>
        <li>Add the target='_blank' attribute to open the link in a new tab</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Relative Links, like to our <a href='misc/extras.html'>extras page</a>.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>These are best when you are referring to resources in the same folder or in a stand alone section of your website</li>
        <li>Pay close attention to the folder you are telling it to look in!</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Root-Relative Links, like to the <a href='/'>home page</a> of our website, butt those aren't useful to us right now.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The only different between a root-relative link and a relative link is that a root-relative link <em>starts</em> with a forwad slash which represents the root of your site.</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
