      <div class="main-question">Name the sites where you can discover where trivia night is happening in Pittsburgh... <a href="http://analog.onlineclock.net/" target="_blank"><em>I'll wait.</em></a></div>
      <div class="main-content">My proposal is to design a website that acts as an intelligent and responsive database where users can look up any trivia night that is happening in Pittsburgh.</div>
  </div>
</div>

  <div class="layout">
    <div class="layout-header">What will it look like?</div>
    <div class="layout-content">
      <p id="content-1">The main page will be simple and consist of a header and four buttons. Each button will refer to a different way to search for a trivia night. For example, by:</p>
    <ul class="features-list">
      <li class="features-menu">Location</li>
      <li class="features-menu">Day of the Week</li>
      <li class="features-menu">Theme</li>
      <li class="features-menu">Drink Special</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="content-2">The buttons on the front page will lead to the corresponding page which will feature the data arranged according to that specific attribute. In total, I see this website containing 5 pages overall. But that is not set in stone, of course.</p>

    <div class="people-header">What needs to happen?</div>
    <div class="people">
      <ul class="people-list">
        <li class="person"><strong>Research:</strong> We will need to collect the necessary data to build our database</li>
        <li class="person"><strong>Organization:</strong> We will need to organize the data into a structure that makes sense with the layout of our website.</li>
        <li class="person"><strong>HTML:</strong> We will need to build a strong and sensible structure to the webpage so the information can be accessed efficiently.</li>
        <li class="person"><strong>CSS:</strong> We will need to design an attractive and user-friendly website that you, your mom, and your trivia-whiz grandma will all want to use.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="people-content">Any of these task can be done by any and all members of the group, so long as it is coordinated.</div>
