  <h1>Casey's Proposal</h1>
    <h2>Name the sites where you can discover where trivia night is happening in Pittsburgh... I'll wait.</h2>
      <p>My proposal is to design a website that acts as an intelligent and responsive database where users can look up trivia nights happening in Pittsburgh.</p>
    <h2>What will it look like?</h2>
      <h3>The Landing Page</h3>
        <p>The main page will be simple and consist of a header and four buttons. Each button will refer to a different way to search for a trivia night. For example, by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Location</li>
            <li>Day of the Week</li>
            <li>Theme</li>
            <li>Drink Special</li>
          </ul>
          <img src="images/IMG_4704.jpg" width='400' alt='Sketch of landing page'/>
      <h3>Inner Pages</h3>
        <p>The buttons on the front page will lead to the corresponding page which will feature the data arranged according to that specific attribute.</p>
        <p>In total, I see this website containing 5 pages overall. But that is not set in stone, of course.</p>
      <h2>What is Involved?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Research: We will need to collect the necessary data to build our database</li>
        <li>HTML: To build the structure of the webpage</li>
        <li>CSS: To design the style of the webpage</li>
      </ol>
        <p>Any of these task can be cone by all members of the group if the work flow is organized well</p>
