      <div class="main-question">Name the sites where you can discover where trivia night is happening in Pittsburgh... <em>I'll wait.</em></div>
      <div class="main-content">My proposal is to design a website that acts as an intelligent and responsive database where users can look up trivia nights happening in Pittsburgh.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="layout-container">
  <div class="layout-header">What will it look like?</div>
  <div class="layout-content">The main page will be simple and consist of a header and four buttons. Each button will refer to a different way to search for a trivia night. For example, by:</div>
  <ul class="features-list">
    <li class="features-menu">Location</li>
    <li class="features-menu">Day of the Week</li>
    <li class="features-menu">Theme</li>
    <li class="features-menu">Drink Special</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="features-content">The buttons on the front page will lead to the corresponding page which will feature the data arranged according to that specific attribute. In total, I see this website containing 5 pages overall. But that is not set in stone, of course.</div>
