        <div class="title">Trivia Night Search Engine</div>
        <div class="command">Name the sites where you can discover where trivia night is happening in Pittsburgh... <em>I'll wait.</em></div>
        <div class="proposal">My proposal is to design a website that acts as a responsive database where users can look up any trivia night that is happening in Pittsburgh.</div>
      </div>

  <div class="layout">
    <div class="subtitle">What Will It Look Like?</div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>The main page will be simple and consist of a header and four buttons. Each button will refer to a different way to search for a trivia night. For example, by:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li class="feature">Location</li>
          <li class="feature">Day of the Week</li>
          <li class="feature">Theme</li>
          <li class="feature">Drink Special</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The buttons on the front page will lead to the corresponding page which will feature the data arranged according to that specific attribute. In total, I see this website containing 5 pages overall. But that is not set in stone, of course.</p>
      </div>

  <div class="people">
    <div class="subtitle">What Needs To Happen?</div>
      <ul class="steps">
        <li class="person"><strong><em>Research:</em></strong> We will need to collect the necessary data to build our database</li>
        <li class="person"><strong><em>Organization:</em></strong> We will need to organize the data into a structure that makes sense with the layout of our website.</li>
        <li class="person"><strong><em>HTML:</em></strong> We will need to build a strong and sensible structure to the webpage so the information can be accessed efficiently.</li>
        <li class="person"><strong><em>CSS:</em></strong> We will need to design an attractive and user-friendly website that you, your mom, and your trivia-whiz grandma will all want to use.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Any of these task can be done by any and all members of the group, so long as it is coordinated.</p>
